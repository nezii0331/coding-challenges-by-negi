 * Day 02: Class vs. Instance

/*
 * Throwdown â€” Class vs. Instance
 * In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages.
 * Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!
 * 
 * Task
 * Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
 * 1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
 * 2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
 *    - If age < 13, print You are young..
 *    - If age >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager..
 *    - Otherwise, print You are old..
